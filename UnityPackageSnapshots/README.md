# UnityPackage Snapshots

These are our own exported `.unitypackage` files from our `DiceGlow` CVR Projects. It's here for the purpose of specific library dependencies, where ones needs only part of our stuff instead of the whole.

**It is however recommended to just download nightly release of our whole package** (`Assets/JOELwindows7` folder) from our [Action Build](https://github.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/actions).

If you insist only needing part of library without who knows need the bloat, then here are the smaller packages. Feel free to use those.

Keep in mind, **these are not up to date** unlike our Action Builds.

## Before you install partial version of UnityPackage

You must first install our `_CORE` folder first with `DiceGlowCoreFiles.unitypackage`. These are shared assets for all our creations.

Then, follow install other dependencies listed in each of these snapshot `README.md` files.

To read `.md` a.k.a. Markdown files, install [this package](https://github.com/gwaredd/UnityMarkdownViewer.git). Copy the link, in Package Manager window, click `+`, click `Git URL`, and paste it. Click OK.
