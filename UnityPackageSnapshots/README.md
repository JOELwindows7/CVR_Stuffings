# UnityPackage Snapshots

These are our own exported `.unitypackage` files from our `DiceGlow` CVR Projects. It's here for the purpose of specific library dependencies, where ones needs only part of our stuff instead of the whole.

**It is however recommended to just download nightly release of our whole package** (`Assets/JOELwindows7` folder) from our [Action Build](https://github.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/actions).

If you insist only needing part of library without who knows need the bloat, then here are the smaller packages. Feel free to use those.

Keep in mind, **these are not up to date** unlike our Action Builds.
