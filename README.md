<!-- Pls include all free but CCK, to backup! -->
> ~~Some packages (e.g. `.unitypackage` extracted) are included for ***convenience***~~ All $0 & Redistribution allowed licensed `.unitypackage`s are included.  
> **Pls keep the Steam Audio with ones caught by kjoy** at `ThirdParty/kjoy/SteamAudio.unitypackage`. Using version above this will cause entire project hangs to `assembling C# scripts` **forever**.  
> If you got this, simply close the project, remove 2 plugins in `DiceGlow/Assets/Plugins`: `SteamAudio` & `FMOD`, along with their `.meta` files. Then reopen this project, and install the correct version shipped by kjoy.
> **DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL ANY CUSTOM RENDERING PIPELINES!!!** I tried and it broke the entire project (revert back to last backup!), and it's hard to manage compatibilities across multiple custom shaders. If you have the fix or better way to make every creation looks astonishing without needing complicated pipelines, let us know.
>
> We are aware that there are concerns regarding sparsdated assets. We understand that gamers have difficulty for those are not $0, and we have no rights to intervene your act. However, in order to keep us safe from Federals vengeance, please follow these orders bellow:
> **(For Perkedel Cinematic Universe gamers) DO NOT USE ANY OF THE PAID ASSETS UNTIL KAORFA PAID THE LICENSE!**. Wait until there is `PAID` flags in it, if there is, then all gamers to contribute must buy it (not using sparsdated file you got out there 😉, for legal reason). For legal reason complying Earth's law. See below what if Kaorfa who lives IRL, caught.
> **(For real life gamers & Kaorfa) CONTRIBUTORS ARE REQUIRED TO OWN EACH AND WHICH LICENSES OF ABOVE PAID ASSETS BEFORE INVOLVING ANY OF THEM**. For legal reason complying Earth's law. If we (kita) were caught using Sparsdated assets, we would be harrassed by a Federal branch claiming protecting the author, until death or cease of use, both options with extra huge fines!

<!-- 
Garaves (X0p1r4t3): Guys, you better put this in all anyways instead, can't we? uh.. We're going to have so many plugins assets here! Paid assets are still few enough to manage. Free ones, no longer! which is great, no offense! That's neat! But uh.. Let's just expect contributors REALLY CAN BUY STORAGE, and only. YOu know, coz we spread to archive. No huert spreading free assets huh? right??

Gyouter: Thank you for your feedback. We will together discuss this.

Info: Current Ignore settings are: Common Free, Paid. Current Always include settings are: Gone 404 (including reuploads).

Joel: idk what am I thinking, We call these DMCAers Federals, that's what X0p1r4t3s from Admiral Zumi to his citizens calls them. There are alot of them, spread across galaxies with one goal, that is to enforce legit buying and if necessary, harrass the sparsdators until they stop doing that, and then anything ends, impose huge fines without mercy. That's why it's called `Federals`. Alot yes, Spreading yes, One same or similar goal yes. I think I just ruined another 🌈 Rainbow true meaning just like that Germany guy once upon a time who formerly a farmer, and then upset about his nation got troubled something2, and became full on chancelor of some military organisation idk. or maybe bluntly, uh.. ruined what does 🌈 actually means normally, and ruined by.. umm to mean include something that's.. **too more**, away from God's intent. I can't think a better word atm, I'm sorry! Find me word easier to say than `Federals` and originally means negatively, what? `Dee Em See Ae` is hard to say!

### Proves of purchases

Please attach screenshots below for the assets we have paid to be used by Perkedel Cinematic Universe gamers.  
For real life contributors, you must purchase the license of your own, not sparsdated you got out there 😉. For legal reasons. We do not want you get harrassed by your Federals because caught using sparsdated assets.

## Quick Tutorials

### Assets

<!-- PLS COMPLETE THIS! -->

#### How to World

Make sure in your Unity Scene, there is a GameObject with component `CVRWorld`. by default, this object now is your spawn point you can place around, AS WELL AS Panoramic preview photo cam (for CVR Portal).

You can however, make another empty `GameObject` to be assigned as one of the spawn points. Simply position that `GameObject` to anywhere you'd like the player to spawn at. the `CVRWorld` accepts more than 1 and you can make it pick randomly.

The `CVRWorld` will also spawn component `CVRAssetInfo` automatically. **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

#### How to Avatar

Make sure in this Avatar you'd like to upload has these commponents:

- **CVRAvatar**
- CVRAssetInfo (Automatic). **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

##### To Avatar Properties

In the `CVRAvatar`, you should see section `Advanced Settings` underneath `Advanced Tagging`. Enable this section, and add your `Input`.

?? AND THEN HOW TO ASSIGN STATE BREAST EXPAND ??

#### How to Props

Make sure the GameObject you'd like to upload as an individual prop has these components:

- **`CVRSpawnable`**.
- `CVRInteractable`. To allow interaction actions.
- `CVRAssetInfo` (Automatic). **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

~~Any other components like MonoBehaviour based and derivatives should be working & load in the software. Ensure also that it is not harmful.~~ **NO, IT DOES NOT WORK!!** You must use niche CVR Scripting system with `CVRVariableBuffer`ed GameObjects as the children of this prop. Scripting is coming soon. use CVRLua mod idk..

##### To Pickup Props

Ensure that your prop has component `CVRPickupObject`.

Drag its own transform into field `gripOrigin`, **and don't forget the `maximumGrabDistance` property**, to ensure the object can be dragged only by certain distances. If you forgot and kept 0, the object will be pickup-able at any range, and this is usually undesirable.

You also need to ensure that `CVRInteractable` is intact. the `CVRPickupObject` triggers events `onGrab` & `onDrop` respectively.

##### To Sticky Props

Ensure that your prop has component `CVRAttachment`.

Assign the `attachmentType` to whichever element you'd want this object attached to. You can chose `none`, `everything`, or some of which. Usually, it is desired to be the `bone`.

Assign the `boneType` to whichever avatar bone you'd want this object attached to, if you included `bone` in `attachmentType`. Usually, it's desired to be attachable to `head`. Sometimes or rarely: `chest`, feet, etc.

**Ensure you finally adjust your `maxAttachmentDistance`!** At least try the usual like 1, or less (`.9`, `.5`, `.25`, etc.) depending on the size and shape. If you forgot and let it 0, the prop would attach / stick forever by any range and you must delete it in the game to restart the prop.

Once you've configured your desired properties, **don't forget to attach methods to the `CVRInteractable`**. Assign these as follow:

- Trigger `onGrab` has method call to `CVRAttachment` on this prop of `deAttach()`. Detach the prop when being picked up.
- Trigger `onDrop` has method call to `CVRAttachment` on this prop of `attach()`. Once dropped, evaluate if it's on something can be attached to and attach to the valid part of the object.

To disable attachment later, simply set `attachmentType` in `CVRAttachment` to `nothing`. The prop then no longer stick-able.

### Moar Tutorial

#### How to Path Camera

Cinematic Path camera allows you to make the camera runs dolly in specified pen path. It uses your Numpad Key on the right of your keyboard

- `NUM0` = Add point.
- `NUM1` = Start
- `NUM3` = Stop
- `NUM7` = Delete all path points
- `DEL` = Delete selected path point. Unfortunately, `NUMPERIOD` a.k.a `DEL` in numpad does not work.
- `NUM+` = Increase time on selected path point
- `NUM-` = Decrease time on selected path point
- Drag a path point (`RMB` on a path point) = Select a path point. Selected path point turns yellow, and turns rest of path points back to white.
- Drag its dot (`RMB` on the path point's dot) = Adjust pen curve strength to this path. Think it like using Pen Tool in image & vector editing software.

#### How to Tholin's Namebadge

TODO: pls do

Pay attention to these files. You need to clone the following to your own folder:

- `CPU.rendertexture` & `CPU 1.rendertexture`
- `EmuMat.material` & `Register.material`
- `program.png`

> Tips: Make sure to clone the file within the Unity editor, so that the `.meta` files are aligned with each file.

## UUIDs GUIDs

Here are the UUIDs of all these assets we uploaded to CVR:

<!-- TODO: Table pls -->

> Commissioned assets still private? We apologize, those are the commissions customer haven't yet paid to this day, and therefore long procrastinations to press `Submit to Public`.  
> Desperate of trying one? Contact us, JOELwindows7 at Discord under DM prefix `PLS_SHARE_ASSETS` and then the UUID(s) & your ABI account username. We will share that/those to you. Absolutely $0  
> As always, source code making these asset **are always open source** & you can implement to your world!  
> Please note, to avoid confusion it is advised to reupload the assets. Just let me do it. To break procrastinations, Simply pay full or part by part in crowd until full to which UUID, to [Joel's Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/joelwindows7)  
> by putting donation pay & message like e.g.: $?? `UNPROCRASTINATE 92f6e5f4-e860-42fd-8154-81d69f605099`. Any added amount will slowly reduce procrastinations. If the payment pool reaches `FULL` for this UUID commission, the procrastination will be removed immediately. Extra accidental extras will not be refunded and will be considered donation tip, thank you so much.  
> C'mon, I need money & my parents will retire soon. But I'm not an asshole, just.. I'll long it (and times later to be public), because you don't pay. I can't work without money, I'm bio being!
>
> PS: If you did not handover the GUID or selected wrong GUID (i.e. already published GUIDs), we will pick random GUID.

### Assorted

These are the GUID from our cache folder of CVR.

- ..

## Additional Info

### GUID

Ensure to detach the GUID if you'd like to make new variant of these prefabs.

For employee: **DO NOT LOSE THE GUID!! MAKE SURE IT IS STILL ATTACHED, & IS SAME MATCH WITH THE PAGE IT UPLOADED TO!**

### Control Bola

How to Control:

First, start the machine by sitting on the orange chair.

- Left Joystick / WASD = Move the Bola
- ESC / Right Option Menu? = Stand up & shut down the machine.

### Audio Link Surround Experiment Paused

You need to edit:

- `.cginc` core file to have each and every speaker. There is `_AudioTexture` `sample2D` property to take a look.
- `.shader` to `include` to each and every `cginc` per speaker
- `.material` to point to each and every shader there is per speaker

Property for `cginc` & Global Shader Updater Property name, was all `_AudioLink`:

- `_AudioTexture_CF`
- `_AudioTexture_SubL`
- `_AudioTexture_LF`
- `_AudioTexture_RF`
- `_AudioTexture_LS`
- `_AudioTexture_RS`
- `_AudioTexture_LB`
- `_AudioTexture_RB`

Wait no, just have one `_AudioLink` `sample2D` for each of `.cginc` file. Then each different shader includes which `cginc` to which speaker.

Alternatively for now, have a script that control this `AudioLinkController`, to change reference audio source to different speakers. Yes, unfortunately at the moment, CVR does not support scripting & has strict whitelisted MonoBehaviour scripts rule by default. You may hack around by changing experimental settings and disable Bundle Verifier, who knows, haven't tested yet, **but it's not safe & not recommended**.

### Video Player not working

BUG REPORT: https://feedback.abinteractive.net/p/youtube-dl-sometimes-did-not-ship-with-it-video-player-does-not-work-on-some-people

![Log found using Mod: MelonLoader, CVRLogger++. ChilloutVR is unable to find the software needed to download the video, which is `youtube-dl`.](/DiceGlow/Assets/Sprites/Screenshots/cvr_uses_youtube-dl.png)

ChilloutVR uses [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download the video, and then either with Network Sync to broadcast the playback, or locally play depending on that GameObject video player component setting right now. The part that plays the video is powered by AVPro. Somehow, the `youtube-dl` either **did not shipped with**, OR had obvious permission trouble (i.e. `Program Files` folders have strict permissions).

To remedy this, simply download `yt-dlp`. Why `yt-dlp` you ask? Because unfortunately current stable version of `youtube-dl` is broken, and in need dire update to be released due to ever breaking YouTube policies. The `yt-dl` is a fork of `youtube-dlc` which is also fork of `youtube-dl` or so in between, and **it happens that this forks works pretty well today**, thanks to auto-updating API methods in every attempt of downloading (the JSON manifest on how to download YouTube video is always fetched per attempt), I think.

Pick just the regular [`yt-dlp.exe`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#release-files). Once you have downloaded it, place this EXE file into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ChilloutVR\ChilloutVR_Data`, **& then rename is to `youtube-dl.exe`**.

Now, try again. If your log says `killing youtube-dl timeout`, try re-pasting the URL again to try load again. It should work now. When it successful, the log should say something about **AVPro playback broadcasting**.

### World Rule of NO Private 3D Model allowed

***Feedback cannot be made nor published to Feedback ABI due to obvious disagreeabilities***.

A world rule that disallows Avatar that its privacy setting not `Public`. If a gamer entered the world / instance with rule set, wearing this kind of avatar, their avatar will be replaced with 2D Placeholder sprites like censored ones.

Application possibilities:

- in World, rule that were set alongside props & fly permissions.
- in user Setting, to be alongside with View Safety settings like NSFW, Horror, Violence, Particle, Giant & Micro sizes, Effects, etc.
- in instance, rule that were set alongside props & fly permissions.

This idea was inspired from Blender Surreal Meme realm where **nobody is allowed to wear body that has no Public Download Link and Paywalled Download link** (anything that Kaorfa never had grasp with the 3D model said). The NPCs there are all simple primitives being & can be said an AI. The visitors who typically have more complex conciousness structures usually respects these cultures by also creating avatar that is also a simple primitives with added complex features, **and agree to make these special avatars public no exception**.

If the visitors who ended up here either had no usable avatar, OR wore a Private Avatar, their body will be immediately swapped with random primitives shapes with random / signature colors, usually `Default Cube`, `Suzanne`, `Stanford Rabbit`, or `Utah Teapot`.

Yeah pls download link. peck you, proprietarists!

### Is ChilloutVR indeed much more intuitive than VRChat?

> Further testing & experience required in order to build conclusion

In VRChat, your Unity Project creation menu in VRChat Creation Companion has 2 options: `Avatar`, & `World`. Each uses different SDK. ***TEST LACKING, IS IT POSSIBLE TO SINGLE PROJECT FOR ALL?**

In ChilloutVR, you only need to create a Unity Project for that version asked, then install the all-in-one SDK (called Content Creation Kit). All `World`s, `Avatar`s, & new `Prop`s can be created, modified, and uploaded just in 1 single projects. Note that if you had `World` marker, you need to disable (or delete but it's not recommended) or move to new un`World`ed Unity Scene & place all to be uploaded stuffs there, in order to upload & update `Avatar`s & `Prop`s.

As of my flawed testing in November 2023 (no VRChat test, just glance), Indeed CVR is much more intuitive, although I understand people would disagree, since without tidying system VRChat has (VCC), it may makes a mess & recovery a hassle. But again, there would be polar opposition that says VCC eats another disk space & deems unecessary. Your mileage may varies.

Ah what do you know? in VRChat you login with username, **and password**. **Main Password**. BUT, in ChilloutVR, you login with your username, **and your CCK key**. Your specialized key you got in your dashboard, **not main password**.

Remember, since CVR is the new guy in the VR Social media, they take a while to catch up.

<!-- Pain Massword -->

### UNITY TOOK LONG TIME TO LOAD!!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Well what do you know? It is expected. We're not in Godot where everything is super optimized and super light by default. You know.

If your PC **has no**:

- Highest end CPU (critically Core i7 OR Ryzen 7, OR anything that has at least 6 real cores & and each rate from at least 4 of them 2 GHz)
- Highest end NVMe SSD, where the Unity project resides in (putting on Game Harddisk is as same slow as regular Harddisk, YOU MUST put it in an NVMe SSD where it is connected to NVMe M.2 slot directly to your motherboard, not SATA SSD of any kind (Neither M.2 nor SATA, don't get scammed!))
- Highest end RAM with highest possible Hz & Size (Critically totals to 32 GB and up, and conclusive usable rate by 5000 Mhz and up)

It will take long, and more file adds longer it is. Therefore you need a combination of those above, & a **Highest end GPU** you could possibly find (critically, with Nvidia XX60 Ti or not, OR AMD Radeon XX60 XT or not, or anything able to VR at medium setting). Without those above, it may take up to 5 hours to start! & without enough GPU, it is impossible to render viably.

Even with ultimate today spec that won Overclocking contest yesterday, you may still experience long time loading I think about 2 minutes. Remember, this is Unity, not Godot.

### Are these done by Realizer division?

Not officially. Although some Realizer members had involved, still it was done by serveral other volunteers at Perkedel Technologies who worked with this in their free time.

Due to different settings and goal with the game engine CVR used, There is no dedicated division handling content creation for this social media. So, Ricitello, **PECK YOU!!**  
Also actually we've been having beef with Unity in general. `Made with Unity`, No permanent buy, etc. etc.

### Weren't you supposed to make your own Godot social media?

Creating social media on its own is huge responsibilities. It is not a simple hassle and burdens to take. While the server (for usual opinions) will be as neutral as possible & dev themselves may not, these days, neutrality is a necessity. Or let's say, **siding a necessity**, in which **it is required to ban people on certain usual opinion sets** in favour of bigger more evil threats that must be obeyed, in order to legally operate, among other things.

Although, VR Sandbox can still be possible, **BUT** without the social media capability. It won't be GodotChat. **Meja** (Open Source Tabletop simulator clone). More like industrial physics simulation framework.

This **Kantor 369 Meja** is one that will officially be built by Realizers. Later.

### Unity?! Don't they will steal your soul?

Fortunately, in desperation, Unity had partially rolled back their new paywallism-partialism agendas. Therefore, only by the new version after 2024, will they succ our soul like Shang Tsung.

Therefore, the version of Unity (`Unity 2021.3.23f1`) used by AlphaBlend Interactive & for these creations of it are **not subject to Neo-Paywall-Partialism / Runtime Fee agenda**. Everyone in this version should be safe, for now. Because if not wrong, these legacy versions shall be supported until spans of 2024. However, we have yet confirmed would Unity impose punishment us gamers who stuck in these legacy version prior to this agenda.

Be knowledgeful also, that ABI already built their software & set goals for long since before. Therefore, to stop and *port* to other engines is not a viable option. This can only be done from scratch with different set of instructions. We shall see further, so stay tuned.

### Why did you include `NAME`?! They are all partialists

We unfortunately have no choice but include these shaders, due to other modules have used such shader, hence depends on it. We hope that these modules uses features available in Free edition only, and say if they did used paid feature, can be replaced back to the free sets ones without breaking.

Perkedel and affiliates condemn highly, the act of partializing feature sets under micro-transactions or any similar system, as well as basically paywalling assets. If you have any questions, let us know, under DM Prefix `CVR_PAID_ASSET_CONCERNS`.

### Discord Exclusive Downloads

Per Archive Protocol established on 2023, It is now forbidden to place assets under exclusive download behind join guild, for especially with Discord, to join over 100 servers / guild **requires nitro / premium subscription**. Therefore all assets, updated newer, and even any version locking assets will be unignored and all employees have been instructed to unignore & forbid ignoring these kinds of assets.

It is forbidden to place assets under login requirement.

> Paid (Actively on sale) assets are still forbidden to be unignored, due to strength of Earth people mental warfare & artileries. There shall no be provocation allowed at this time.
> You sure you'll fulfill your promise on eventually releasing features into free tier? I don't have time to hear whether you did, so feel free treat as `breaking promise`. Right?? ... uh.. yeah, in my opinion.

### Car too expensive

CVR trusted [Realistic Car Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/realistic-car-controller-16296) (i.e. whitelisted), and [has been suggested by Dippy to be used to make car props](https://youtu.be/3lWsYM_n1qg?si=jdOltEHmjnfOjFtU). However, we have already seen, that it is **way too expensive** and not all gamers have privilege by their parents and/or many factors.

Indie Scripting support therefore is a must to unshackle our creativity away from requiring such asset just to get there.

> Please do not include nor even sparsdated RCC! Keep this asset folder to yourself 😉.

<!-- and your family. Salam X0p1r4t3! -->

Please test these other Free car assets and confirm whether or not they works:

- null. Custom MonoBehaviour is forbidden by default.

### Legit Purchase Disclosure

> In response of backlash towards Van Elektronische on grounds of involvement of X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensmnt which concerning parties claim notorious for sparsdating assets

We have heard your concern. We understand that such organisation involvement in this checkpoint leaves an immense distaste to you, the concerning parties. Rest assured, No assets should these were sparsdated, shall never enter this repository, **until Kaorfa (JOELwindows7) himself paid for those assets**. The payment proof will promptly be included at above section, once the transactions is complete. And, **No paid assets to be unignored either**. All gamers who wanted to contribute **are required to provide the assets should be involved here, which are paid, on their own**, until the alternative was manufactured.

In order to relieve you, the concerning parties, we would like to fully disclose Kaorfa's parameter, on paid files, as follows:

- Kaorfa had ceased sparsdating `video games`, since around 2012, and the transition so to speak had been completed, in around 2016's. Today, Kaorfa will readily purchase new games legitly, if he inclined so. Unless of course, such games are no longer available to purchase legitimately, or unviable to support should the company beholding behaves badly.
- Kaorfa already **lost over $100 in total and counting**, to purchase `assets`, legitimately.
- Kaorfa **already spent over $3000 in computer information equipments**, to download these assets & games, and use them to inspire & create more creative works out of those.
- Kaorfa's **mother would not be happy and furious**, should she found that Kaorfa spent that much of a money over serveral assets, such as one that costed him $30 a being / pack. In fact, on purchasing hardwares alone, Kaorfa is today strictly being monitored and requires low chance approval processes. Kaorfa is indeed under immense pressure, required to mend good spending behaviour & reduce reckless shopping. And as the result, this has risk of compromising integrity & will of disclosure towards his own parent, which has already shown, Kaorfa is silently purchasing assets and games in his same bedroom alone, often times away from his parent's supervisions. Kaorfa had once been caught, and threatened to have all giving money / uang jajan to be ceased permanently with no way to recover. You would not want to hear Kaorfa pleading about this, trust us.
- Kaorfa **has a niche job requirement** and **none of the job fits Kaorfa's laidback & sleep but still have money style**, null, non existent. As the result, Kaorfa is fully relying on his mom's giving money to this day, and projected until her retirement.
- Kaorfa's boring side job salary has been **unstable & became unreliable**, due to change of management at the company he works at. Now the salary has tremendously shrank significantly, and the transaction only done once in every multiple months, instead formerly every week more you diligent and lucky.
- Kaorfa **has been fed up with paywallism, proprietarism, & partialism**. And has this sympathy towards his gamers. If Kaorfa feel roadblocked upon any of these, then he has feeling for other gamer's same set of challenges just to get there, and it's the reason Kaorfa has been long since, looking for ways, so that the gamers won't have to encounter the same roadblock as he did. If the product is untriable on some, it's not working there. If it somehow tried without being paid, that's because that nation could not understand the price, as when you think it's cheap, for them, it's like standard drinkable water is luxury. ~~Trust us. begging like beggar is harder than to give~~.

Additionally, This checkpoint project, and others under our command have rules, all participant required to obey, in particular regarding assets and costs:

- All assets must be obtained legitimately as it can.
- All assets should this one paid, requires proof of transaction where Kaorfa commited towards beholding owner of the assets.
- Should the proposed assets comes from sparsdat, Check previous point.
- Assets that have met the legitimacy condition above, still cannot be included in the repository it sits to be. These files must be `.gitignored` to prevent provocation against the beholding owner of the assets
- Should the assets are discontinued & gone 404, legitimacy rules voids & preservation now falls & engages at the discretion of the project managers.
- Credits for assets as all as possible are required & irrevocable by any means. **Even for Public Domain assets**. At least, to attribute Sauce URL to each and every set of assets involved.

We also would like to apologize, as many of our member of this checkpoint project had uttered abundant amount of insults against the beholding owners when their assets are paid. This is because of this project policies in effect, that permit unfiltered & uneditorialized utterance from the member, in accordance with main protocol No. ???? stating `Integrity & Honesty`, where words are required to be seen by other gamers, without censorship, or worse turns manipulated / oppositely lying. This will not be fixed & request for such cover ups will not be accepted, due to above's policy. We apologize for your inconveniences.

## Death Timer

**Contract Unavailable yet. Contract is draft.**

Escalation into a contract is being discussed. When Wakturia deems it viable, it would be then escalated.

Reason = Unity next gen betrayals series 2023.

Observing:

- Unity Engine. Could be mass abandoned, in which usage population observably reduced down to less than 100K gamers
- ChilloutVR. **Could be ceased**, due to that Unity's ever growing tactic of genocide. Could be a statement regarding inviability handling Unity's bad behaviours, even working around around older the latest Runtime-fee-free version ever activatable by creators & themselves, where it no longer works and must upgrade to Runtime Fee agenda enabled versions. In event of critical situation (which hopefully does not reach), ABI is suggested to restart everything from scratch with Godot (Neos Unreal & VRChat Unity & others already exists, but not Godot). Also, ABI is suggested not to abandon critical support due to a particular competitor whose used same Unity Engine, and ensured to add all suggested & requested last feature sets before going into apocalypse mode.
- This. Following fate of ChilloutVR for its supporting status, and observing populations of userbase in common setting (normal & modded), not including post-apocalypse userbase (i.e. Overmodded Frankensteined already abandoned CVR).

> It has been rumored that extra factor of death are believed to be paid & private (proprietary, exclusive to certain people) assets. Each Assets you need to buy & never accessble are each nail in these coffins, one to Unity, twice to CVR. Perkedel states that these are our employees' opinion and we will observe whether or not that this opinion is convertible into facts, by opening opportunities such as Free just for Perkedel atleast (Give assets to Joel for $0 willingly), and evaluate if such encouragement would remove enough amount of nails in the coffin.

Otall (X0p1r4t3): Woi, langsung aja ya? gw rasa gk kaya FNF kemarin yg mesti ancam nyawa. ini can cuma Unity bakal mati gitu2

Toresheleni (X0p1r4t3): Nggak, soalnya ada aset2 yg kontributor dari kitanya yg bajak. Contohnya RCC udah kesebar di Lobe Living 4. mesti lihat dulu nih, apakah mereka ngelihat.

Neshim M'neer (Wakturia): Saya rasa sih nggak deh, kalau gk dishare disini semoga gpp. Mending kalian jangan sampai masuk Discordnya Kaorfa.

Otall: Nggak nggak, kita gk bakal masukin kok. kami sebarnya lewat pinjam USB.

Neshim: Sip.

Toresheleni: (Dodo is recording, Viorfas in this topic are tasked to document tasks transparently) Woi, itu ngapain Dodo?

Dodo (Viorfa): Eh?

Toresheleni: Woi, matiin! Para Federal bakal ngelihat ini! Ketahuan kita!

Neshim: (hold) dah gpp gpp gpp.

Toresheleni: Woi matii..n, ini kita lagi ngomong aset terpaksa! Si Federal udah tahu tak segan2 nyari cara kok dimasukin?

Neshim: Tenang. Biar kami yang urus.

Otall: Kok pakai acara rekam2 rekaman sih, apalagi ini?

Neshim: Maaf. Kebijakan transparansi pekerjaan, Jadi, Viorfa harus tugas.

Otall: Aduh, Joeeel, Joel, ya jangan dong! Ntar kita semua yang habis salah siapa?

Neshim: Udah2, i.. ini mana lagi yang mesti dirapiin.

Info: Gamers who live in X0p1r4t3 city Living Lobe 4 are opportunists, who always ready to take on various hobbies, new and old. Programming C# for Unity is among one of them. Until there was the betrayal recently, where everyone began to abandon Unity, but then canceled partially in favour of ChilloutVR. Fun fact, we started doing ChilloutVR content creation as a request of some of the gamers, who turns out are those 4th Living Lobe housers! Yeah, shoutout to them. 4 has Kaorfa learned for vain in his college (Yes, Joel in his day at Binus University had learned Unity). But atleast it got used again right? Well, sort of. 

Joel: Also pls don't ask to borrow my USB Flashdisk, buy your own, unless you're my close family. Blend in! I promise I'll make car script whenver CVR supports custom scripting, as all I can.
 -->

> UPDATE: We are unable to determine its death timer, as we believe that ChilloutVR has no sign of degradation or sickness whatsoever. However, We do find that Unity **indeed has** been dying, due to their reckless acts. But for this one, This is simply too slow & therefore long due to abundant amount of users already trusted Unity. We can simply reduce the scope of overlooking up to only New Version which officially stated being the only one and forth that has Runtime Fee.  
> All and all, This project fortunately, can't be considered contract since that would be too long for an oathed job. Instead this will be considered... We have no name yet, but for now, it's Checkpoint.
