## Quick Tutorials

### Assets

<!-- PLS COMPLETE THIS! -->

#### How to World

Make sure in your Unity Scene, there is a GameObject with component `CVRWorld`. by default, this object now is your spawn point you can place around, AS WELL AS Panoramic preview photo cam (for CVR Portal).

You can however, make another empty `GameObject` to be assigned as one of the spawn points. Simply position that `GameObject` to anywhere you'd like the player to spawn at. the `CVRWorld` accepts more than 1 and you can make it pick randomly.

The `CVRWorld` will also spawn component `CVRAssetInfo` automatically. **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

#### How to Avatar

Make sure in this Avatar you'd like to upload has these commponents:

- **CVRAvatar**
- CVRAssetInfo (Automatic). **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

##### To Avatar Properties

In the `CVRAvatar`, you should see section `Advanced Settings` underneath `Advanced Tagging`. Enable this section, and add your `Input`.

?? AND THEN HOW TO ASSIGN STATE BREAST EXPAND ??

#### How to Props

Make sure the GameObject you'd like to upload as an individual prop has these components:

- **`CVRSpawnable`**.
- `CVRInteractable`. To allow interaction actions.
- `CVRAssetInfo` (Automatic). **DO NOT FORGET TO NOTE ITS GUID!**

~~Any other components like MonoBehaviour based and derivatives should be working & load in the software. Ensure also that it is not harmful.~~ **NO, IT DOES NOT WORK!!** You must use niche CVR Scripting system with `CVRVariableBuffer`ed GameObjects as the children of this prop. Scripting is coming soon. use CVRLua mod idk..

##### To Pickup Props

Ensure that your prop has component `CVRPickupObject`.

Drag its own transform into field `gripOrigin`, **and don't forget the `maximumGrabDistance` property**, to ensure the object can be dragged only by certain distances. If you forgot and kept 0, the object will be pickup-able at any range, and this is usually undesirable.

You also need to ensure that `CVRInteractable` is intact. the `CVRPickupObject` triggers events `onGrab` & `onDrop` respectively.

##### To Sticky Props

Ensure that your prop has component `CVRAttachment`.

Assign the `attachmentType` to whichever element you'd want this object attached to. You can chose `none`, `everything`, or some of which. Usually, it is desired to be the `bone`.

Assign the `boneType` to whichever avatar bone you'd want this object attached to, if you included `bone` in `attachmentType`. Usually, it's desired to be attachable to `head`. Sometimes or rarely: `chest`, feet, etc.

**Ensure you finally adjust your `maxAttachmentDistance`!** At least try the usual like 1, or less (`.9`, `.5`, `.25`, etc.) depending on the size and shape. If you forgot and let it 0, the prop would attach / stick forever by any range and you must delete it in the game to restart the prop.

Once you've configured your desired properties, **don't forget to attach methods to the `CVRInteractable`**. Assign these as follow:

- Trigger `onGrab` has method call to `CVRAttachment` on this prop of `deAttach()`. Detach the prop when being picked up.
- Trigger `onDrop` has method call to `CVRAttachment` on this prop of `attach()`. Once dropped, evaluate if it's on something can be attached to and attach to the valid part of the object.

To disable attachment later, simply set `attachmentType` in `CVRAttachment` to `nothing`. The prop then no longer stick-able.

### Video Player not working

BUG REPORT: https://feedback.abinteractive.net/p/youtube-dl-sometimes-did-not-ship-with-it-video-player-does-not-work-on-some-people

![Log found using Mod: MelonLoader, CVRLogger++. ChilloutVR is unable to find the software needed to download the video, which is `youtube-dl`.](/DiceGlow/Assets/Sprites/Screenshots/cvr_uses_youtube-dl.png)

ChilloutVR uses [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download the video, and then either with Network Sync to broadcast the playback, or locally play depending on that GameObject video player component setting right now. The part that plays the video is powered by AVPro. Somehow, the `youtube-dl` either **did not shipped with**, OR had obvious permission trouble (i.e. `Program Files` folders have strict permissions).

To remedy this, simply download `yt-dlp`. Why `yt-dlp` you ask? Because unfortunately current stable version of `youtube-dl` is broken, and in need dire update to be released due to ever breaking YouTube policies. The `yt-dl` is a fork of `youtube-dlc` which is also fork of `youtube-dl` or so in between, and **it happens that this forks works pretty well today**, thanks to auto-updating API methods in every attempt of downloading (the JSON manifest on how to download YouTube video is always fetched per attempt), I think.

Pick just the regular [`yt-dlp.exe`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#release-files). Once you have downloaded it, place this EXE file into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ChilloutVR\ChilloutVR_Data`, **& then rename is to `youtube-dl.exe`**.

Now, try again. If your log says `killing youtube-dl timeout`, try re-pasting the URL again to try load again. It should work now. When it successful, the log should say something about **AVPro playback broadcasting**.

### Whitelists

#### Whitelisted assets

Known Whitelisted Unity Assets are:

- [Realistic Car Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/realistic-car-controller-16296). BoneCrackers. Make drivable car props
- Magica Cloth Gen1 & Gen2.

Custom own MonoBehaviour are not supported, since these needs the `dll` assembly to be installed onto CVR. A Lua Scripting support coming soon.

#### Whitelisted URL for Video Player

Known Whitelisted domains in CVR for Video Player are:

- [VRCDN](https://vrcdn.live)
- [YouTube.com](https://youtube.com)

### Are these done by Realizer division?

Not officially. Although some Realizer members had involved, still it was done by serveral other volunteers at Perkedel Technologies who worked with this in their free time.

Due to different settings and goal with the game engine CVR used, There is no dedicated division handling content creation for this social media. So, Ricitello, **PECK YOU!!**  
Also actually we've been having beef with Unity in general. `Made with Unity`, No permanent buy, etc. etc.

### Weren't you supposed to make your own Godot social media?

Creating social media on its own is huge responsibilities. It is not a simple hassle and burdens to take. While the server (for usual opinions) will be as neutral as possible & dev themselves may not, these days, neutrality is a necessity. Or let's say, **siding a necessity**, in which **it is required to ban people on certain usual opinion sets** in favour of bigger more evil threats that must be obeyed, in order to legally operate, among other things.

Although, VR Sandbox can still be possible, **BUT** without the social media capability. It won't be GodotChat. **Meja** (Open Source Tabletop simulator clone). More like industrial physics simulation framework.

This **Kantor 369 Meja** is one that will officially be built by Realizers. Later.

### Unity?! Don't they will steal your soul?

Fortunately, in desperation, Unity had partially rolled back their new paywallism-partialism agendas. Therefore, only by the new version after 2024, will they succ our soul like Shang Tsung.

Therefore, the version of Unity (`Unity 2021.3.23f1`) used by AlphaBlend Interactive & for these creations of it are **not subject to Neo-Paywall-Partialism / Runtime Fee agenda**. Everyone in this version should be safe, for now. Because if not wrong, these legacy versions shall be supported until spans of 2024. However, we have yet confirmed would Unity impose punishment us gamers who stuck in these legacy version prior to this agenda.

Be knowledgeful also, that ABI already built their software & set goals for long since before. Therefore, to stop and *port* to other engines is not a viable option. This can only be done from scratch with different set of instructions. We shall see further, so stay tuned.

#### Sauces Unity Runtime Fee

### Why did you include `NAME`?! They are all partialists

We unfortunately have no choice but include these shaders, due to other modules have used such shader, hence depends on it. We hope that these modules uses features available in Free edition only, and say if they did used paid feature, can be replaced back to the free sets ones without breaking.

Perkedel and affiliates condemn highly, the act of partializing feature sets under micro-transactions or any similar system, as well as basically paywalling assets. If you have any questions, let us know, under DM Prefix `CVR_PAID_ASSET_CONCERNS`.

### Discord Exclusive Downloads

Per Archive Protocol established on 2023, It is now forbidden to place assets under exclusive download behind join guild, for especially with Discord, to join over 100 servers / guild **requires nitro / premium subscription**. Therefore all assets, updated newer, and even any version locking assets will be unignored and all employees have been instructed to unignore & forbid ignoring these kinds of assets.

It is forbidden to place assets under login requirement.

> Paid (Actively on sale) assets are still forbidden to be unignored, due to strength of Earth people mental warfare & artileries. There shall no be provocation allowed at this time.
> You sure you'll fulfill your promise on eventually releasing features into free tier? I don't have time to hear whether you did, so feel free treat as `breaking promise`. Right?? ... uh.. yeah, in my opinion.

### Car too expensive

CVR trusted [Realistic Car Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/realistic-car-controller-16296) (i.e. whitelisted), and [has been suggested by Dippy to be used to make car props](https://youtu.be/3lWsYM_n1qg?si=jdOltEHmjnfOjFtU). However, we have already seen, that it is **way too expensive** and not all gamers have privilege by their parents and/or many factors.

Indie Scripting support therefore is a must to unshackle our creativity away from requiring such asset just to get there.

> Please do not include nor even sparsdated RCC! Keep this asset folder to yourself ðŸ˜‰.

<!-- and your family. Salam X0p1r4t3! -->

Please test these other Free car assets and confirm whether or not they works:

## Death Timer

**Contract Unavailable yet. Contract is draft.**

Escalation into a contract is being discussed. When Wakturia deems it viable, it would be then escalated.

Reason = Unity next gen betrayals series 2023.

Observing:

- Unity Engine. Could be mass abandoned, in which usage population observably reduced down to less than 100K gamers
- ChilloutVR. **Could be ceased**, due to that Unity's ever growing tactic of genocide. Could be a statement regarding inviability handling Unity's bad behaviours, even working around around older the latest Runtime-fee-free version ever activatable by creators & themselves, where it no longer works and must upgrade to Runtime Fee agenda enabled versions. In event of critical situation (which hopefully does not reach), ABI is suggested to restart everything from scratch with Godot (Neos Unreal & VRChat Unity & others already exists, but not Godot). Also, ABI is suggested not to abandon critical support due to a particular competitor whose used same Unity Engine, and ensured to add all suggested & requested last feature sets before going into apocalypse mode.
- This. Following fate of ChilloutVR for its supporting status, and observing populations of userbase in common setting (normal & modded), not including post-apocalypse userbase (i.e. Overmodded Frankensteined already abandoned CVR).

> It has been rumored that extra factor of death are believed to be paid & private (proprietary, exclusive to certain people) assets. Each Assets you need to buy & never accessble are each nail in these coffins, one to Unity, twice to CVR. Perkedel states that these are our employees' opinion and we will observe whether or not that this opinion is convertible into facts, by opening opportunities such as Free just for Perkedel atleast (Give assets to Joel for $0 willingly), and evaluate if such encouragement would remove enough amount of nails in the coffin.

<!-- 
Otall (X0p1r4t3): Woi, langsung aja ya? gw rasa gk kaya FNF kemarin yg mesti ancam nyawa. ini can cuma Unity bakal mati gitu2

Toresheleni (X0p1r4t3): Nggak, soalnya ada aset2 yg kontributor dari kitanya yg bajak. Contohnya RCC udah kesebar di Lobe Living 4. mesti lihat dulu nih, apakah mereka ngelihat.

Neshim M'neer (Wakturia): Saya rasa sih nggak deh, kalau gk dishare disini semoga gpp. Mending kalian jangan sampai masuk Discordnya Kaorfa.

Otall: Nggak nggak, kita gk bakal masukin kok. kami sebarnya lewat pinjam USB.

Neshim: Sip.

Toresheleni: (Dodo is recording, Viorfas in this topic are tasked to document tasks transparently) Woi, itu ngapain Dodo?

Dodo (Viorfa): Eh?

Toresheleni: Woi, matiin! Para Federal bakal ngelihat ini! Ketahuan kita!

Neshim: (hold) dah gpp gpp gpp.

Toresheleni: Woi matii..n, ini kita lagi ngomong aset terpaksa! Si Federal udah tahu tak segan2 nyari cara kok dimasukin?

Neshim: Tenang. Biar kami yang urus.

Otall: Kok pakai acara rekam2 rekaman sih, apalagi ini?

Neshim: Maaf. Kebijakan transparansi pekerjaan, Jadi, Viorfa harus tugas.

Otall: Aduh, Joeeel, Joel, ya jangan dong! Ntar kita semua yang habis salah siapa?

Neshim: Udah2, i.. ini mana lagi yang mesti dirapiin.

Info: Gamers who live in X0p1r4t3 city Living Lobe 4 are opportunists, who always ready to take on various hobbies, new and old. Programming C# for Unity is among one of them. Until there was the betrayal recently, where everyone began to abandon Unity, but then canceled partially in favour of ChilloutVR. Fun fact, we started doing ChilloutVR content creation as a request of some of the gamers, who turns out are those 4th Living Lobe housers! Yeah, shoutout to them. 4 has Kaorfa learned for vain in his college (Yes, Joel in his day at Binus University had learned Unity). But atleast it got used again right? Well, sort of. 

Joel: Also pls don't ask to borrow my USB Flashdisk, buy your own, unless you're my close family. Blend in! I promise I'll make car script whenver CVR supports custom scripting, as all I can.

### Rules

- All models will be included in the repo and will be shared.
- Think 10 times before doing this commission
- Sparsdat the Assets: **NOT ACCEPTING YET**, status may change one time.
  - `NO` = Sparsdated assets nor Paywalled assets to be sparsdated will be rejected
  - `YES` = Sparsdated assets and/or Paywalled assets to be sparsdated will be accepted like normal service
  - Protolocer Probability as of 2024 for span 2000-2100 = 99.999% towards `NO`. Note = `Copyright Infringement is obvious mistake`.
  - Goned assets will still be included as per Perkedel's Archive Policy.
- Paywalled Assets: **NOT ACCEPTED**, No exclusive gift allowed, all gamers must be able to freely download. Insisting requires the source assets (especially `.blend` file) **also to be shared** both here & on Admiral Zumi's channel with full notes pointing to your name & the contract informations.
  - If you are upset about this rule, picked other commissioner & they are better than me, **then the next contract will be $0**. Do not lose the voucher.
  - If above regret contract is about the same asset, **then you'll have another $0 voucher**. FINALLY! You finally shared your sexy uwu latex avatar to all gamers, THANK YOU!! Like that.
  - **above voucher won't always apply and approval is random chance.** Do not try to abuse the system. I will see it.
- Free, unpaid commission / request may have have long procrastinations. Engage unrefundable donation in how much to our Ko-fi https://ko-fi.com/joelwindows7 to remove this procrastination, with message of case number. If you accidentally paid under, simply repay the rest, OR wait for little bit / partially boosted service to finish.
  - In random case, if I found the asset topic is being e.g. sought after, your contract may be instantly expedited **free of charge**.
  - And out of some, if this is critically sought after, **it can even bypass INACTIVE status**!! Who knows!
  - So if you are really sure that the 3D Model were sought after to be here in CVR, don't hesitate to consult with us (JOELwindows7, Discord), and we'll gladly review and discuss. 
  - Note again, you shall not expect things would be done fast.
