# MothBoi 2.0(VRC)

## What's in here?

Assets to make my MothBoi 2.0 avatar(For VRC). The original was created by [AviSlime](https://avislime.carrd.co/). This a rebuilt version that has dynamic bone colliders for emmVRC users along with basic quest compatibility and some slightly different animations.

## Todo

- [ ] Change the sit-down animation to a cross-legged one.
