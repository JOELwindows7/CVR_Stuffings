# Scripting Permission

ChilloutVR comes with Scripting system. It allows Worlds, Props, & Avatar to have advanced functionality & interactibility beyond what built-in CCK & Unity component (such as `Animator`s) provides.  
The Scripting system uses Lua script. An open source programming language that has low learning curve (relatively easy to learn) & is a popular language embedded in many softwares & games.

For safety reasons, ChilloutVR disables scripting onto certain level by default, specifically on **Props** & **Avatars**. If your spawned prop does not work, or other player avatar view experience does not work fully as they require scripting, you may want to enable these Scripting permission on all level. You can achieve this through the Setting menu.

## How to manage & enable Scripting permission

1. Open Menu
    - Big menu = `ESC` / `A`
    - Quick menu = `Tab` / `???`
1. Click Cogwheel (`Settings`)
1. Go to either or both category: `Props Filter` &/or `Avatar Filter`
1. Scroll down until you see `Scripts`
1. Set these dropdown on both or either categories into `Everyone`, depending on your preference.
1. Reload these items
    - For Avatars, still in `Avatar Filter` category, scroll to bottom most & press `Reload Avatars`. This will reload all avatars including yourself.
    - For Props, the player that spawned that prop must delete & then respawn it again. Alternatively, you can also rejoin the same Instance.

For Worlds, the scripting is always on (*`Need Confirm`*).

Most of the time, it is recommended to set both Scripting permissions to `Everyone`. However, if you experience certain lags, disasters, or troll attacks, then you may temporarily manage those permissions, and do certain additional steps necessary.

> Bonus Tips: You can also install `World Prop List` available in CVRMG Melon Assistant to view list of props, manage, open its page, & forbid certain malicious props. For mental health reasons, **it is recommended to purge prop block list regularly except props that are confirmed just designed to be malicious & not testing experiments**.
> Bonus Tips 2: If certain Avatar worn by user is considered malicious, you may mute their avatar by visiting their page & then unshow their avatar. To do this, open any menu, Press & Hold Alt while aiming to that user & click, and view their visibility setting. Set `Avatar` to `Hide` (*`Need Confirm, Need step`*). For mental health reason, **it is not recommended to immediately press `Block` nor `Kick`** unless they kept being malicious.

Enjoy the scripted experience.
