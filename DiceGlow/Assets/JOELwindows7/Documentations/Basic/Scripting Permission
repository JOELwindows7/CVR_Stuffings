# Scripting Permission

ChilloutVR comes with Scripting system. It allows Worlds, Props, & Avatar to have advanced functionality & interactibility beyond what built-in CCK & Unity component (such as `Animator`s) provides.  
The Scripting system uses Lua script. An open source programming language that has low learning curve (relatively easy to learn) & is a popular language embedded in many softwares & games.

For safety reasons, ChilloutVR disables scripting onto certain level by default, specifically on **Props** & **Avatars**. If your spawned prop does not work, or other player avatar view experience does not work fully as they require scripting, you may want to enable these Scripting permission on all level. You can achieve this through the Setting menu.

## How to manage & enable Scripting permission

1. Open Menu
    - Big menu = `ESC` / `A`
    - Quick menu = `Tab` / `???`
1. Click Cogwheel (`Settings`)
1. Go to either or both category: `Props Filter` &/or `Avatar Filter`
1. Scroll down until you see `Scripts`
1. Set these dropdown on both or either categories into `Everyone`
1. Reload these items
    - For Avatars, still in `Avatar Filter` category, scroll to bottom most & press `Reload Avatars`. This will reload all avatars including yourself.
    - For Props, the player that spawned that prop must delete & then respawn it again. Alternatively, you can also rejoin the same Instance.

For Worlds, the scripting is always on (*`Need Confirm`*).

Enjoy the scripted experience.
