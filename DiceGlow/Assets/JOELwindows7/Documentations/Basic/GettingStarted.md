## Exploring contents

in ChilloutVR, begin by exploring contents. Here, we have **Worlds** you can visit, **Props** you can spawn on an instance, & **Avatars** you wore that represents yourself.

Open up the **Menu**, & click `Search` in the center. Search by your keyword & you should see different assets on different categories you can pick: Users, Worlds, Props, Avatars.

> [!TIPS]
> If you are unsure what to search, you can search `___` (Triple underscore). It will give up up to 100 random assets for each category.

You can also start visiting existing instance by going to the **Menu**, `World` tab. in `Active Instances`, you can see the world that has **Public Instances** active.

## Visiting World

Once you've chosen the world, click any of the instance beside the `(+)` (New instance) button, & click `Join`. Wait until the download complete & moved to that world. Say hi to the people there.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to always follow the basic social etiquette, like you do IRL. For the best result, use the international / intergalactic version of the etiquette instead of your regional.

## Creating Instance

If you wish to start an instance of yourself, you can do so in the same World page. While still in the world page you've just been on, simply click `(+)` (New Instance) button, & choose your privacy mode. Then `Create Instance`. Click on that newly created instance of yours & `Join`.

You can also invite your friend to this instance. Ensure beforehand, they are ready to accept your invite.

### Inviting Friends

> You can manually attempt to find & visit the instance which invites you to in case of ignoration. You can only do this for non-private instance.  
> Invite is the only way to join a private instance.

## Adding friends

Once you've gotten to know the people, or brought your current friends to here, you can now `Add Friends` to the player you've seen here. The `Add Friend` button is in each player page. You can reach to this with either the easy way, or the manual way.
