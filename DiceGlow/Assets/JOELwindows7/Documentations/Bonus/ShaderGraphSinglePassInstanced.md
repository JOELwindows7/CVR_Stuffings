# ShaderGraph Single Pass Instanced

![Overview image showing comparisons between treated & untreated shadergraphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/overview_z3y_shadergraph.png)

It is possible to make your ShaderGraph automatically support & generate the SPS-I directive onto the shader code result, to ensure this shader renders for both eyes.

Single Pass Instanced rendering mode, draws a shader **just once** then sent to all eyes. It is much more performant since it only does the draw call one time, unlike its Multi-pass counterpart. It helps remove lags due to numbers of eyes added as in before Single Pass, where for every eyes the shader got redrawn

ChilloutVR exclusively uses Single Pass rendering mode, meaning all shaders must do support this Stereo Rendering mode. Otherwise, the shader will appear only on the first eye (left eye).

To make the shader support Single Pass, one can simply implement serveral Stereo Rendering directives, into the `.shader` code. However, fiddling with these files are finicky & very risky, as every files are different for where to exactly implement the directives, among other functions & properties that would not be relevant resolving this problem.

Thankfully, a solution was provided in particular for ShaderGraph where one can simply replace the render target with the modified ones that adds such Stereo Rendering directives, making workflows done intuitively with minimal risk.

## Before you begin

- Install ShaderGraph. the name is `com.unity.shadergraph`. It should be there built-in the Package Manager at registry `Unity Registry`.
- Ensure your VR debugger render mode is set to something like `Single Pass Instanced`  ![as shown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/make_sure_mockHMD_spsi.png)
- Know how to install Package out of GitHub / GitLab / GitIdk repo (basically repository that has `package.json` file in its root directory)
    - Open sub-window tab `Package Manager` (Top menu `Window`, `Package Manager`)
    - Click top left `âž•ðŸ”»` icon
    - Choose `Add package from git URL`
    - insert your git URL (that ends with `.git`, add if haven't already ; or according to instruction down below) into the pop up.
    - `Add`  ![as shown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/add_git_url_package.png)![and the popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/now_insert_git_url.png)

## 2021.3

For Unity 2021.3 series, you can use z3y's extension at https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph.

Install this package via Git URL: `https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph.git`.

Don't worry about the `2022`, it should work here.

Now, all you have to do, if you'd like to make new ShaderGraph, pick `Builtin (z3y)`. You can choose the same out of 3 types, such as `Lit Shader Graph`.  
![image shown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/right_click_create_z3y_shadergraph.png)  
For existing ShaderGraph:
- open up the graph file (your shader graph file in `.shadergraph` here in Unity). A new sub-window tab of the file will open.
- In `Graph Inspector`, open up tab `Graph Settings`. 
- Delete internal `Built-in` active target & replace with `Built-In (z3y)`.  ![image shown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/main/DiceGlow/Assets/JOELwindows7/_CORE/Sprites/Screenshots/replace_with_z3y.png)

> **WARNING!**: Do not mix & match active target between z3y's & internal! You will corrupt the entire graph! If you already closed tab of this file with this condition & unable to open your `.shadergraph` anymmore, you must temporarily disable or uninstall the extension, re-open the `.shadergraph` file, & remove the unecessary active target (just the internal `Built-In`).

## 2019

> Thancc V-TOL for the way you did for your avatar iyey!

For Unity 2019 series, you can use following ShaderGraph packages which versions have been caught & locked by z3y, including the extension

Take a look at [this `2019` tree of the same repo](https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph/tree/2019) OR [V-TOL's copy](https://github.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffings/blob/main/ThirdParty/V-TOL/share/shadergraphex.zip).

Assuming your 2019 project haven't had ShaderGraph, Install the following in order:
- `https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph.git?path=/com.unity.render-pipelines.core#2019` The Rendering pipeline core
- `https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph.git?path=/com.unity.shadergraph#2019` The ShaderGraph itself
- `https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraph.git?path=/com.z3y.shadergraphex#2019` The Extension

> PLS CONTINUE & CONFIRM BELOW

You can now create ShaderGraph using z3y's modified built-in target (`Builtin (z3y)` options which are set to `Built-In (z3y)` active target)

## Different color per eye??

You can set which color to render for each different eyes, following [this Unity's documentation about Stereo rendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/SinglePassInstancing.html), at the last section of the ShaderGraph debugging.

Basically: 
- you need to have a `Custom Node` (right click on field, `Add Node`, search `Custom` & pick `Custom Node`).
- Ensuring that `Custom Node` still selected, in its `Graph Inspector`, scroll down & change the type to `String`.
- `Name` the function properly & insert the content field beneath with `Out = lerp(LeftColor, RightColor, unity_StereoEyeIndex);`. This will lerp the color from one to another between 2 different eyes per `unity_StereoEyeIndex` indexing.
- Add Input of Vector4 `LeftColor` & `RightColor`. as in the function content
- Add Output of Vector `Out`. as in the function content
- **`Save Asset`**
- Right click this `.shadergraph`, `Create`, `Material` to create new material using this new `.shadergraph` shader.
- You can now drag & drop this `.material` onto any mesh you'd like. You can even adjust each of the 2 colors to your desire on this `.material`.
- Test now by pressing top `Play`. If your Mock-HMD (Ensure `Single Pass Instanced` mode on `Project Setting` is selected in that dropdown) is used, you'll see a simulated VR split screen that shows each eyes gets different color according to what you've had selected each in your `.material` properties.
- If you upload this object to CVR, your object should looks like this, where each of your eyes render different color.
