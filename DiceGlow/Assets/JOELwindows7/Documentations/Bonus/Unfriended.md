# Unfriended

Recently, there has been influx of complain that us here in DNB did not consistently follow our global philosophy. You may have noticed that one day someday, that you are no longer friend with `JOELwindows7`.

Please rest assured, that our Kaorfa, `JOELwindows7` **never ever & never would press `Unfriend`**, even at the worst condition of all. Chances are, this might be a bug in the ABI Hub accounts server.

If you find this has happened, simply Request Friend again to `JOELwindows7`. He will gladly accept this offer.

Please note however, that you should not abuse this Friend-ing feature, as if we confirmed you kept doing this pattern, **you will lose `Can I be your friend` Request, possibly FOREVER** & lose future VIP access of our events & facilities. Rest assured also, Per rules of DNB, no employee nor high leaders are permitted to press `Block` nor `Kick`, unless of course you are confirmed malicious (spam scammer).
