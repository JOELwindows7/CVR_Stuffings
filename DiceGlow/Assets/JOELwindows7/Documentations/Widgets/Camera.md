# Camera

ChilloutVR has built-in `Camera` that allows you to take picture in-game, without having to rely on external screenshot tools. It also helps you take more clean & customizable picture, just like your phone camera.

## Controls

### Open & Close

To open the camera, open only index & thumb on both hands, then connect them crossingly (take picture gesture). OR, open the menu, and toggle `Camera` in the homepage, & close the menu.

To close the camera, simply clap the camera. OR, open the menu, and toggle `Camera` in the homepage.

### Taking picture

To Take a picture, you can do either the following:

- Press `F` to pay respect
- Drag (`RMB` / `B`) the camera & Interact (`LMB` / `Trigger`)
- Press `??? Trigger` (???)

### Selecting buttons

Simply aim your laser to the button & press the `Trigger` on which of your hand to interact.  
For Desktop user, hold `ALT` & move your mouse to move only your head, aim with your red dot & `LMB` to interact.

### Drone

You can make your camera do free fly mode & further set its position to where you desire. With this mode, your movement switches to the camera, & you can see your `Drone` as you fly it, while your `Camera` stays as the remote viewfinder.

- Move your `Drone` with `WASD` / `Left Stick`.
- Fly up using `Jump` (`Space` / `A`)
- Fly down using `Crouch` (`C` / `X`???)
- Roll (rotate spin left right) with `Q` & `E` / `???` & `???`

> [!NOTE]
> Turning off `Drone` mode won't return your camera back to its viewfinder, & pinning to where it was instead. You can make further adjustment to yourself, or if you no longer want to pin the camera, you can simply unpin it by toggling the `ðŸ“Œ Pin` button on the top left button of your `Camera`.
