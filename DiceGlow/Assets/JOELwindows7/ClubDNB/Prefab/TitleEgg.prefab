    Thank you for finding me in this hastily made Easter Egg hunt.

    This,
    is Hyundai IONIQ 5. The second best, or probably 1st position best now beating
    Tesla, EV for the entire world.

    As you can see, Kaorfa, since Tesla could
    never be in Indonesia (hence is still import), This becomes his go to dream car.
    Feel free to donate as much as IDR 1 Billion goal so he can buy this car.

    On
    the other hand, One of the first adopter in Dasandim was Wakturia. Particularly,
    a couple & famous former employees named Sky & Latsufir (Yes, that Sky from FNF
    mod, but she''s different & from scratch). She fell in love with this car & you
    can find her did a mission driving it, with Latsufir as her co-driver. Until
    it''s time to retire very early due to toxic society / drama & other safety reasons.
    Now, these 2 live in Latsufir''s newly won from auction realm, Salt Flat World,
    & making innovations to these days. Notably, quantum tunneling improvings that
    helps various transportation going inter-realms.

    Hyundai IONIQ 5 comes with
    decent fast speeds & also already has racing variant, the N. Of course, treat
    all cars including this car as regular car, because it is not auto-piloting car.
    Additionally, where rest or most of the world imports from Korea, in Indonesia,
    Hyundai licensed its new dedicated manufacturing, CKD. Notable skin that also
    ever released was Batik Edition, where the decals are designed after our nature
    signature cultural design, Batik.

    It''s certainly an interesting EV car
    that is not Tesla. One great example of how should it be available to all gamers.

    There
    is also another competitor, notably from BYD with their Atto 3. And what makes
    this model potentially a flagship killer is the highest model could be predictably
    costs a third of the IONIQ 5. Stigma aside, Atto 3 does have its own interesting
    features, notably tablet-like rotating display and more. Aside from just these,
    BYD had yet another interesting and spectacular division, Yangwang, which made
    extraordinary luxury EV car of various types, from sports, to SUV. Infamously,
    their SUV ones had feature that it can be an emergency boat in case if it had
    to fall into pool of water.'
