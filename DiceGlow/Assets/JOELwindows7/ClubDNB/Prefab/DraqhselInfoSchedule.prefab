      value: "Welcome & Congratulations on your enrollment here at our agency. Following
        are your informations & schedules you need to follow.\nAll times are based
        on WIB (UTC +7). If you ask us why not draw a picture, we decided not to
        to avoid exposing our fingerprint to who knows.., (CLASSIFIED).\n\nSchedule:\n8.00
        AM Wake up & Preparations\n10.00 AM Meeting\n13.00 PM Showtime!\n19.00 PM
        End Shift & Clean-up\n10.00 PM Sleep & Recharge\n\nInfo:\n- Refrain attacking
        your original target reference. Building good relationship is a big bonus\n-
        Salary payments are in IDR (Indonesian Rupiah). Crypto (not even Kvz) are
        unavailable at this time\n- Our leader is a bald guy & voices like LEGO City
        guy or Agent 47, & looks like that bald guy. He wears Parang Batik patterned
        office shirt. The one that looks like staircase stacked integral symbol &
        it's chocolate brown.\n- Never late to any of the meeting!! If necessary,
        feel free to skip morning bathing & straight up prepare in Meeting office\n-
        If a person is present on the presence list of the premise you're on but
        they can't be found & instantly disappear without warning, <b>DO NOT ACT!
        REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO THE BALD GUY!</b>. Acting will disrupt the order &
        can ensue the chaos.\n- Always obey to any unexpected early escort if called
        so! This is for your safety, in event of unprecendented situations.\n- For
        best wake up, avoid overnighting beyond 1.00 AM, unless you have job to go
        beyond.\n- <b>NEVER INTERACT WITH WORST TIES AT ALL!</b> To view if ones
        in Worst Ties, use your given Fairphone & Open the Camera mode in the Agency
        app. If you met one of them <b>DO NOT (CLASSIFIED) THEM!</b> A severe penalty
        will be given for those violated.\n- You may buy Fairphone parts at a non-associated
        phone store if you need to. Although we highly recommend to source the replacement
        parts from us for safety reason. Please report any parts you have installed
        from any non-associated phone stores for safety analysis IMMEDIATELY per
        your end of shift.\n- The ROM is intentionally left vanilla rather than flashed
        eOS or any ungoogled ROM. If a Worst Ties found that your phone is untrackable,
        your cover will instantly blows. \n- Unfortunately, you won't be provided
        laptop this decade. It is highly recommended to request laptop from us <b>ONLY
        IF YOU NEEDED IT</b>. Our chosen supplier is Framework. Most mission can
        be done anyway with your phone.\n- It is highly recommended to accept Friend
        Request from Kaorfa.\n- Kaorfa maybe present on your premise. Expect his
        headpat either with his Q/E or VR-FBT.\n- Avoid offending Kaorfa to prevent
        losing headpat access. For more information, consult with the Bald Guy.\n-
        For flee away, always consult with the Bald Guy! Never act the flee away
        on your own! We always have best ways for your flee away.\n- If you find
        a demo either individual or group about <i>Draqhsel Critics</i>, listen carefully
        & send over the replay to us. Chances are, it's only a hoax to down name
        us. A good critics never down name us at all & always offers patches in every
        critic section.\n\nGreat luck! May the <i>social profits chase upon us</i>."
