Requirements:

You MUST import these for the package to function correctly and to be able to upload your avatar! Please make sure to do that first.
Poiyomi Toon Shader can be found here: https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader/releases
The Dynamic bones asset can be found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743

This avatar uses transparent shaders, and will have transparency stacking issues. If you want to remedy this, I would recommend using poiyomi pro V6's grab pass transparency shader: https://www.patreon.com/poiyomi
