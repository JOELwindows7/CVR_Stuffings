Pen Usage:
VR - pick up pens and use the controller's trigger to start/stop the pen from drawing. Note that an erase button appears near the pen's eraser when the pen is held - clicking it while holding it with you other hand will clear all lines from that pen.
Â 
Desktop - right-click and hold to pick up the pens from close range, then left click to start and stop drawing. Tracking of 2D mouse movement in 3D space can result in slightly jagged lines. To erase what you've written, press the E key while holding the pen,

Each pen also has a dedicated eraser (click eraser button to show) which can be clicked / triggered to erase the lines for that color pen.


UI:
VR & Desktop - Hide Pens button hide & lines locally to declutter a player's view. Reset button respawns objects globally if they are lost or hidden. Erasers button shows/hides erasers for desktop users.
