# Moth Cube(VRC)

## What's in here?

Assets to make my Moth Cube avatar(For VRC). Very much a shitpost here.

## Can I use these assets?

Yep for most of them! My assets are all [CC0(Public Domain)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The original image this whole thing was based off of is `moth cube og.jpeg`. I don't have credit for this file as I just sorta ripped it from a reddit post. Sorry about that. Everything else is mine though.
