GoopStreamEffect: Drips, start of the particle systems
  Main
    Duration: How long before the system "loops".
    Start Lifetime: How long until the particle dies "natuarally".
    Gravity Modifier: How fast drip falls.
    Max Particles: The maximum ammount of drips that can be had.
  Emission
    RateOverTime: How many particles are emitted per second.
  Size Over Lifetime
    Size: Curve setting the size of the particle over its lifetime(from emission to death)
      X-Axis: Percent of lifetime
      Y-Axis: Size [0 to max]
  Noise: How flight path of particles are randomly altered.
  Sub Emitters: The particle system that will appear from this particle system.
  Renderer
    Material: Drip Appearence.
GoopSplash: Drips that bounce off the ground.
  Renderer
    Material: Drip Appearence
Pool Emiiter: Creates the pools and dertermines how they fall
  Emission
    Rate Over Time: How many particles over the duration.
Goop Pool: The pools of goop.
  Start Size: A random size between two bounds, may want something smaller
