This was originally dippy's [DippySauce](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087792780639731712/1087794164487442533/DippySauce.unitypackage)

I just changed and reorganized some things.
The original package is contained in here.

To Use:
Take the drip prefab and place it on a bone on the armiture.
Tune any of the particle system parameters to your liking.(Check DripDoc.txt for *some* notes)
